## About Me

Through internships at **Nextqore Inc.** and **Cardinal Integrated Technologies**, I collaborated directly with designers and engineers to improve UI/UX consistency, reduce bugs, and streamline API integrations in React applications. My earlier role at **HSBC Technology** involved implementing automation tools and analytics dashboards that enhanced team efficiency and supported agile delivery.

On the research front, I worked under **Professor Timothy Wood** on LLM-powered indoor navigation and developed end-to-end projects including an LLM chatbot for audio/video transcripts and a sign language assistant integrating AI with Google Assistant.

**Current Focus:**
- Building scalable web applications with modern frameworks
- Exploring AI/ML integration in practical applications  
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Learning advanced system design patterns
